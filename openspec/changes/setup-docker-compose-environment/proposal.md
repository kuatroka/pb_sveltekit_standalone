# Setup Docker Compose Environment

## Why
Currently, the project requires manual installation and configuration of PocketBase, Bun, and SvelteKit, which creates inconsistent development environments across team members and complicates onboarding. A Docker Compose setup will provide a reproducible, containerized development environment that works identically across all machines, simplifying setup and ensuring all developers work with the same versions and configurations.

## What Changes
- Add Docker Compose configuration for orchestrating multi-container development environment
- Create PocketBase service container with persistent volume for database and files
- Create SvelteKit frontend service container using Bun runtime
- Configure networking between containers for seamless communication
- Add environment variable management through .env files
- Include hot-reload support for both frontend and backend development
- Provide comprehensive AI agent guide for implementing the full stack

## Impact
- **Affected specs**: Creates new capabilities for development environment, Docker configuration, PocketBase service, and SvelteKit service
- **Affected code**: New Docker-related files (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml, .dockerignore, .env.example)
- **Benefits**:
  - One-command startup (`docker compose up`)
  - Consistent environments across all developers
  - Simplified onboarding (no manual runtime installation)
  - Isolated dependencies
  - Easy cleanup and reset
- **Requirements**: Developers will need Docker Desktop or Docker Engine installed
